                    This document shows us how technical professional writing has been, in a way, weaponized for the 
                    purpose of dehumanizing the native american peoples by our government. The entire document is focused 
                    only on what the school has taught these people, particularly in terms of physical labor. It is not at 
                    all concerned with the health of the people it is inquiring about, or the mental state, it only cares 
                    for things like what they have been taught to do.

                    Anyone receiving this report at the time it was being used wouldnâ€™t look 
                    at it and think of the actual people who it speaks about, they would look 
                    at it and just care for the figures enclosed. On one of the pages, there is 
                    a field asking how many Native American children had been either withdrawn 
                    or run away. It does not care what reason they were pulled out for, or why 
                    they would have run away, it just wants to know if they are gone, and if they 
                    are returning.
